            <h2>What Are Cookies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small text files that websites place on your device when you visit them. These files contain data about your browsing session and are stored in your web browser. Cookies serve various functions, from remembering your preferences to enabling website features. Web browsers typically allow cookies by default, though users can adjust settings to manage or block them.</p>
            <p>Similar technologies to cookies include web beacons, pixels, local storage objects, and session identifiers. While these technologies function differently from traditional cookies, they serve comparable purposes in web functionality and data collection. This policy covers cookies and similar tracking technologies used on our website.</p>

            <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
            <p>Our website employs a limited selection of cookies necessary for basic functionality. We have organized cookies into categories based on their purpose and function:</p>

            <h3>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
            <p>These cookies are essential for the website to function properly. They enable core features such as page navigation, form submission, and security functions. Without these cookies, the website cannot operate as intended. Strictly necessary cookies do not gather information about you for marketing purposes and do not track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>
            <p>Examples of strictly necessary functions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining secure connections during your session</li>
                <li>Authenticating users when accessing specific areas</li>
                <li>Preventing fraudulent activity and maintaining security</li>
                <li>Ensuring proper routing of page requests</li>
                <li>Remembering items you have placed in forms before submission</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because these cookies are essential to website operation, they are automatically placed when you access our site. You cannot decline strictly necessary cookies while using the website, as doing so would prevent core functionality.</p>

            <h3>Functional Cookies</h3>
            <p>Functional cookies allow the website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced features tailored to your preferences. These cookies collect information about how you use the website but do not identify you personally. The information gathered by functional cookies remains anonymous.</p>
            <p>Functional cookies on our site may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember language or region preferences you have selected</li>
                <li>Recall text size, fonts, and other customizable page elements</li>
                <li>Store form inputs to avoid re-entering information during a session</li>
                <li>Enable video playback and interactive features</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Declining functional cookies will not prevent website use but may limit certain features or require you to re-enter preferences during each visit.</p>

            <h3>Analytics Cookies (Limited Use)</h3>
            <p>We use a minimal set of analytics cookies to understand how visitors interact with our website. These cookies collect aggregated, non-personally identifiable data about page visits, time spent on pages, navigation paths, and technical information such as browser type and screen resolution.</p>
            <p>Analytics data helps us:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify which pages are most frequently visited</li>
                <li>Understand how users navigate through the website</li>
                <li>Recognize technical issues affecting user experience</li>
                <li>Improve content organization and website structure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The analytics cookies we employ do not track your activity across other websites or build profiles for targeted advertising. Data collected through analytics cookies is used solely for internal website improvement purposes. We do not share analytics data with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>

            <h2>Cookies We Do Not Use</h2>
            <p>To clarify our practices, we explicitly do not use the following types of cookies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> We do not place cookies that track your browsing across websites for advertising purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing Cookies:</strong> We do not use cookies to deliver targeted marketing messages or promotional content.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Media Cookies:</strong> We do not embed social media plugins or cookies that track your social network activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Behavioral Tracking:</strong> We do not allow third-party advertisers or networks to place cookies on our website.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Site Tracking:</strong> We do not participate in networks that track your browsing behavior across multiple websites.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cookie Duration</h2>
            <p>Cookies can be categorized by duration into two types:</p>
            <h3>Session Cookies</h3>
            <p>Session cookies are temporary and exist only while you actively browse the website. When you close your browser, session cookies are automatically deleted. These cookies typically handle functions such as maintaining your navigation state, remembering form inputs during your visit, and managing security for the current session.</p>
            <h3>Persistent Cookies</h3>
            <p>Persistent cookies remain on your device after you close your browser. They have expiration dates ranging from days to months. These cookies remember your preferences for future visits and help recognize you as a returning visitor. Persistent cookies on our site have limited lifespans and are automatically removed after their expiration dates.</p>
            <p>The specific duration of persistent cookies on our website ranges from 30 days for preference cookies to 12 months for certain analytics cookies. You can view cookie expiration dates through your browser's cookie management tools.</p>

            <h2>Managing Your Cookie Preferences</h2>
            <p>You have control over cookie usage on our website. While we do not operate an interactive cookie consent banner, you can manage cookies through your web browser settings.</p>
            <h3>Browser Settings</h3>
            <p>All modern web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings menus. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Block all cookies from being set</li>
                <li>Block only third-party cookies</li>
                <li>Delete existing cookies from your device</li>
                <li>Set your browser to ask permission before accepting each cookie</li>
                <li>Clear cookies automatically when you close your browser</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Browser settings vary by application. Common browsers provide cookie controls in their privacy or security settings sections. Consult your browser's help documentation for specific instructions on managing cookies.</p>

            <h3>Consequences of Blocking Cookies</h3>
            <p>Blocking strictly necessary cookies may prevent proper website function. Other website features may operate with reduced functionality or require you to re-enter preferences on each visit. You can browse our website with most cookies disabled, though some interactive features may not work as intended.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>
            <p>Our website primarily uses first-party cookies (cookies set by our domain). In limited cases, third-party service providers essential to website operation may set cookies. These providers are bound by contractual obligations to use cookies only for services they perform on our behalf.</p>
            <p>We do not permit third-party advertising networks, analytics services beyond basic traffic monitoring, or social media platforms to place cookies on our website. Any third-party cookies present are strictly functional and necessary for website services.</p>

            <h2>Global Privacy Control Recognition</h2>
            <p>We recognize and honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals sent by your browser. GPC is a technical specification that allows users to signal their privacy preferences regarding data sales and sharing. When we detect a GPC signal from your browser, we treat it as a request to opt out of any activities that would constitute a sale or sharing of personal information under applicable privacy laws.</p>
            <p>Since our website does not sell personal information or use cookies for cross-site tracking or targeted advertising, enabling GPC will not substantially change your experience. However, we acknowledge and respect this signal as an expression of your privacy preferences.</p>

            <h2>Updates and Changes</h2>
            <p>We may modify this Cookie Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. When we update this policy, we revise the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of this document. Material changes will be reflected in the policy text.</p>
            <p>We encourage you to review this Cookie Policy periodically to stay informed about how we use cookies. Continued use of the website after policy changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

            <h2>More Information About Cookies</h2>
            <p>If you would like to learn more about cookies generally, independent resources are available online that explain cookie technology and privacy implications. You can also review your browser's help documentation for information about managing cookies specific to your browser application.</p>

            <h2>Questions and Contact</h2>
            <p>If you have questions about our use of cookies or this Cookie Policy, please contact us using the information provided at the top of this page.</p>
